We need to make an orders processing list, in which will be customers, who made orders on our products. We should be able to:

1. Add customers who did orders to orders processing list;
2. Remove customers from it;
3. Get customers from list by their name;
4. Get customers from list by their ID;
5. Show the full list ordered by customers IDs;
6. Show the full list ordered by customers last names;
7. Show the full list ordered by customers invoice value;
8. Save the orders processing list on my hard drive with being able to choose realization: serialization, marshalling to XML or JSON.
9. Load the orders processing list from existing files on my hard drive.
